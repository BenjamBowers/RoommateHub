# RoommateHub
This is a web hub for me and my roomates to keep track of things like chores, reminders, etc. It's hosted locally on a raspberry pi using Apache.

## Chore Board
The chore board uses JavaScript and PHP to update the appropriate files on the raspberry pi regarding the chores for each day.
